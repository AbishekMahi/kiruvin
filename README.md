<!-- 1. Google AdWords

Google AdWords is the platform where advertisers bid on keywords that people search for using Google's search engine. An advertiser buys a keyword to appear when someone searches for that specific word. If a person clicks on the ad, they are taken to the website and if the visitor makes a purchase, then the advertiser gets paid.

2. Display Network

Display network ads are similar to banner ads. When a user visits a page, the advertiser's ad appears on top or bottom of the page. These ads are included in many different websites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and blogs.

3. Remarketing

Remarketing is a way to advertise to users who have already visited your site. You can create remarketing lists based on the pages that visitors viewed before leaving your site. You can use these lists to show advertisements to people who have previously shown interest in your products.

4. Search Console

Search console is a tool provided by Google that lets you manage your campaigns and track conversions. It provides conversion data, traffic reports, and a lot of other useful information.

5. Keywords

Keywords are words that are relevant to your business. In advertising, keywords help to describe what you sell or offer. By choosing appropriate keywords, you increase your chances of appearing in the search results.

6. Cost Per Click (CPC)

Cost per click (CPC) refers to how much you pay each time someone clicks on your advertisement. A low CPC means that you’re paying less per click; a high CPC means that you‘re paying more per click. The average cost-per-click rate in Canada is $0.30/click.

7. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

The cost per acquisition (CPA) is the price you pay for every sale. The CPA depends on how long it takes the customer to complete the transaction. For example, if the customer completes the transaction in 30 seconds, you may charge a lower CPA than if the transaction took 5 minutes to complete.


Web application development is the process of creating a website or web-based application. It involves designing, coding, and testing of the application. The process of developing a web application can be divided into three parts: front-end development, back-end development, and testing. 
 Front-end development deals with the design and coding of the user interface, while back-end development deals with the server-side coding. Testing is done to ensure that the application is working as intended and is free of any errors. 
If you are planning to develop a web application, then it is important to have a clear understanding of all the three parts of the process. In this article, we will give you a brief overview of each part of the process. -->
